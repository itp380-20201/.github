**Your Current Grade:** Z (Zero)

**Feedback:** You have not implemented enough of the spec correctly to show a meaningful amount of work. To get an R, you need to implement more of the spec and request a regrade.

[[Please provide 1-2 sentences of feedback to the student. For example..."When I run the game I just get an empty window and nothing shows up on screen."]]

**IMPORTANT:** If you think this is a mistake (eg. you forgot to push your code or it's possibly a platform issue), please talk to your instructor or grader ASAP. If you can show to us this was the case, then we will still allow you to regrade higher than R.

_Note: When you're ready for a regrade, please push your updated code and reply to this issue. Regrades will occur on the schedule as discussed in class. Keep in mind that only your grade by the end of the regrade period counts. However, keep in mind that a Z initial grade means you cannot regrade higher than R._
